# Emu8_z80
A CASIO fx-ES PLUS series calculator emulator for TI-83 Plus series calculator.

## Introduction
NOTE: This program is currently unfinished.

The goal of this program is to emulate an Lapis LSI named ML610901, which is used by CASIO fx-ES PLUS series scientific calculators, on a TI-83 Plus series calculator.

Currently the target is only TI-83 Plus and its monochrome variants.
